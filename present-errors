THe big goal--> use on a robot

I want to hook up a gyro and an accelerometer and have the combined data from this sensors give acceleration, velocity and position for any object they are attached to. To fully understand the process and to grasp the limitations of the sensors themselves, I want to start from the ground up and work out all the code.

I just two sensors will work but just up to a point. Additional data from other sensors can be added refine the output from the two. For example, a second accelerometer for example combined with the first could be used to give changes in orientation to complement the gyro data. Ideally, it could also be used to track the pivot point of the bot. THis data could also be confirmed or corrected by wheel encoders. 

THe point is NOT to have stand alone sensors, but to have each sensor working with the group to give more reliable kinematic data.

TODO:

1) convert where possible float numbers to int which are native to Arduino (faster)

2c) Change to trapazoidal rule for area for gyroSums

3) Self calibration DURING operation ... a = 9.8 check rotation etc.

4) Once the gyros are working reliably ...

	find a,v and d
